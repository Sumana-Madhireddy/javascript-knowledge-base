# JavaScript Knowledge Base

## Introduction
JavaScript is a powerful and versatile programming language originally designed to make web pages interactive. Over time, it has evolved beyond the browser, allowing developers to build servers, mobile applications, and databases using JavaScript-based technologies.

## What Makes JavaScript Special?
âœ… Full integration with **HTML/CSS**  
âœ… Simple and beginner-friendly syntax  
âœ… Supported by **all major browsers** by default  
âœ… Runs in the **browser and on the server**  

## How JavaScript Works
JavaScript code is executed by **JavaScript engines** embedded in web browsers. Some popular engines include:

- **V8** â€“ Used in Chrome, Opera, and Edge  
- **SpiderMonkey** â€“ Used in Firefox  
- **JavaScriptCore** â€“ Used in Safari  

The engine reads and compiles JavaScript into machine code, optimizing performance during execution.

## What Can JavaScript Do?
ðŸ”¹ Modify webpage content dynamically  
ðŸ”¹ Handle user interactions (clicks, key presses, etc.)  
ðŸ”¹ Communicate with web servers (AJAX, Fetch API)  
ðŸ”¹ Store data on the client-side (Local Storage, Cookies)  

## JavaScript Limitations in Browsers
For security reasons, JavaScript in browsers **cannot**:  
ðŸš« Read/write arbitrary files without user action  
ðŸš« Directly access OS functions  
ðŸš« Interact with other websites unless explicitly allowed (**Same Origin Policy**)  

## Beyond the Browser: JavaScript Everywhere
JavaScript is not limited to web pages! It can also run on:

- **Servers** â€“ With Node.js  
- **Databases** â€“ Using technologies like MongoDB  
- **Mobile Apps** â€“ With frameworks like React Native  

## Languages That Compile to JavaScript
Several languages extend JavaScriptâ€™s capabilities, including:

- **TypeScript** â€“ Adds static typing (Microsoft)  
- **CoffeeScript** â€“ Cleaner syntax for JavaScript  
- **Dart** â€“ Googleâ€™s language for web and mobile apps  
- **Kotlin, Flow, and Brython** â€“ Other alternatives for JavaScript development
